# RFID

Project name : **Access control System**

Description : An RFID reader emits a low-level radio frequency magnetic field that energies the tag. The tag responds to the reader’s query and announces its presence via radio waves, transmitting its unique identification data. This data is decoded by the reader and passed to the local application system via middleware. The middleware acts as an interface between the reader and the RFID application system. The system then searches and matches the identity code with information stored in the host database or back end system. In this way, accessibility or authorisation for further processing can be granted or refused, depending on results received by the reader and processed by the database.
